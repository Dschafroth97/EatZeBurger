# Burger


### Overview

A burger logger made with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

### Before You Begin

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
